# My-DSA-Project
Here you can find the code for my project ''Passenger Tracking System''  in Data Structures and Algorithms.
Features of this project are : 
1.Booking a ticket
2.Checking ticket status
3.Cancel ticket
4.Checking details of booked ticket

* This project mainly tracks the passenger's from the time they book their ticket.
* Once they book their ticket they can cancel it till the program gets terminated or in this case till the bus starts.
* They can check the status of their tickets.
* Once the ticket is booked or canceled a mail will be sent to the passengers.
* Once the pass-code is entered the program gets terminated and all the details of the passengers will be saved in a json file.
* Once the program gets terminated no passenger can perform any of the mentioned functions.
* Once the program is terminated a mail will be sent to the passengers regarding their tickect details.
* The passengers will recieve warning mails before they reach their destination.
* Finally the passengers will recieve a final mail with a Thank You Note.
